## Requirements

You must have a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account to run this application(with hosting, storage, and database enabled). For item indexation and search, the application uses [Algolia](algolia.com). Finally, for maps, you are going to need a valid Google Maps API Key.

## Features

Nearo's main features are:

- Optimized for mobile
- Multiple images per post
- Google Maps view
- Any authentication available in Firebase
- Geo-tagging and searching
- Item sharing for Facebook and Twitter
